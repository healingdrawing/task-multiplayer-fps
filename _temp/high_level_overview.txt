Summary game based on boilerplate code based on "Bevy" game engine and bevy network game library "Lightyear".

At the beginning moment game boilerplate code looked like black screen with 2d camera displayed square moving by wasd, for every connected client/player.

In process of server development, server was simplified to tiny window, to decrease CPU usage.

In process of client development:

- default 2d camera was replaced by 3d camera with perspective projection to display level in front of player.
--main.rs 292--
With "MyCameraMarker", to get camera later using query and move the camera.
--client.rs 468--

- Second 3d camera with orthogonal projection was added to display minimap.
--main.rs 333--

- The "w a s d" keys were changed to arrows.
--client.rs 144--

player movement was changed to move in 3d space.
--shared.rs 54-- calculate changes
--shared.rs 92-- apply changes

Player position was changed from 2d to 3d. z coordinate used to store angle of player rotation. We do not jump so z value is 0.
--protocol.rs 47--

- The "Space" key was refactored to make player attack the enemy using teleportation outside of the level.
--client.rs 187--
--shared.rs 112--

- To prevent spamming, and decrease network loading, arrows and "Space" keys were refactored to send signals after release the key.
--client.rs 122--

- To 3d world was added duplicated 3d models of the level
--main.rs 385-- for player camera
--main.rs 390-- for minimap camera

, and 3d models of players.
--client.rs 318--

3d models was made in blender, and exported as gltf files of "assets" folder.
Also direct light and ambient light were added.
--main.rs 356--

- after player affected by shot, it teleports outside of the level, on server side it manage all the clients
--server.rs 133--
and then disappears with closing connection and removing from the game world (with few seconds delay).
--client.rs 512--
