2. - what means first x4 lines/commands block in main.rs file?

These commands allow to mute warnings in the code.
The Bevy itself and especially lightyear is actively developed
it is only alpha version of lightyear, so methods changed very often
and to maintainer added these commands to prevent spam in terminal.
And we use them for the same purposes. Later after v1+ release of lightyear
code can become more stable and these commands can be not needed anymore.
